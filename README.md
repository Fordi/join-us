# You should join us over in the Fediverse.

Step 1: [Get yourself any Mastodon account](https://joinmastodon.org/servers).  If you don't feel like searching the server list, I recommend [Mastodon @ SDF](https://mastodon.sdf.org)[^1].

Step 2: Add your Fediverse address to your Twitter bio, in the form of a link, e.g., `https://masto.serv.er/@myUserName` - this will help followers who migrate to the Fediverse find you.

Step 3: Migrate your follows: Head to [Debirdify](https://pruvisto.org/debirdify) and follow the instructions there. You should do this periodically to pick up new Twitter expats you follow.

That's it!

## Basic differences from Twitter

1. Content Warnings are expected, but there's a button for 'em.
2. There is no text search, so #HashTag liberally.
3. "Favorite" is not "like" - there's no fave-based algorithm to tune your feed - but you can follow hashtags. 

Further notes:

* If you own a piece of the web, you can self-verify your Mastodon against it by adding `<a rel="me" href="https://retro.pizza/@fordiman" title="Mastodon"></a>` somewhere on the page.

* If you pick a server and it's performing badly or the community sucks, you _can_ jump servers. Create a new account, mark it as an alias of your old account, then tell the old account to migrate to the new one. Whole process takes 5 minutes. 
Remember that Mastodon is like if Twitter were hosted like e-mail. From a technical standpoint, it kinda doesn't matter which server you're on. From a community or performance standpoint, it can matter.  
  
  But get your feet wet first; don't let perfect be your enemy. 

* Favorites are nice - they let the author know you enjoyed their content - but boosts (mastodon for "re-tweets") are what build the community. Boost often. 

* As in anything, look for the helpers. If you find someone being helpful, follow and boost them so they can reach others!  
  And, you know, also _be_ a helper if you can! 

* A note on cross-posters (like https://moa.party): if you're going to use one (which I don't really recommend), post to Mastodon and let the cross-poster post to Twitter.  
  
  The reason: Mastodon is more featureful, with the built-in content warnings and larger char limit.  
  
  Going the other way makes it harder for existing Mastodon users to keep their feed tidy. So, you know, enter someone else's house like a polite guest and stuff. 

* On Content Warnings:
  
  You can configure your account to never hide them; it's how I roll, at least. Configured this way, I think about them more as subject lines, and you should too. So your politics posts get a helpful "USPOL" lead-in, for example.
  
  They're not a bad thing; they're really useful for the community.

## In closing

Come, join us! Get over here before the bird site collapses under the weight of Elon's stupid.

[^1]: Why I don't recommend my current mstdn host: they're a small, individual server that I elbowed my way into. Potentially flooding my 1,400 followers to a host that had 140 users just last week would be a dickish to [@trixter](https://retro.pizza/@trixter) - who you should absolutely follow.
